CVE-2014-7169 Cookbook
=================

This cookbook is designed to test and optionally remediate the bash "shellshock" bug, more formally known as cve-2014-7169.

Once Chef-client has executed this recipe on one or more hosts, a list of all nodes that are vulnerable to the "Shellshock" exploit can be retrieved from the Chef server via `knife search:`

`knife search node 'languages_bash_shellshock_vulnerable'`

Limitations

This cookbook relies on the OS-native packaging system to provide patched versions of the bash package.
